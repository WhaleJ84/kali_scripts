# kali_scripts

This repository contains my collection of scripts made in my slow effort to automate my adventures in [hacking boxes](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).

## Install

Move the scripts to your desired location within $PATH (e.g. $HOME/bin/), ensure script has execute permissions (use `chmod +x SCRIPT` if not) and run the command through the terminal.

If you just want to test out the script then you can change directory to where it resides and run it with `./SCRIPT` without needing it in your $PATH.
